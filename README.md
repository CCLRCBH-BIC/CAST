### Instruction

* 1. Required libraries
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Python 3 by default, the script is tested on Python 3.6.8.
- [Tensorflow](https://www.https://www.tensorflow.org/): Python 3 by default, the script is tested on Python 3.6.
- [deepmedic](https://github.com/pipiyang/deepmedic): The deepmedic is revised based on https://github.com/deepmedic/deepmedic. When we run the original code on a multiple GPU workstation, it will exhaust all the memories but without reducing computational time. I have modified the code to enable multiple GPUs train a model separately.
* 2. Train the neural network
* 3. Segment a new subject.
